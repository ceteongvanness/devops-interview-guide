#### Basic DevOps Interview Questions for Freshers.

##### 1. What is DevOps?
   
| Characteristics | DevOps |
| ---| --- |
| Basic premise  | A collaboration of development and operations teams. It is more of a cultural shift.  |
| Related to     | Agile methodology                                                                     |

| Benefits       | Speed, functionality, stability, and innovation                                       |

##### 2. How do you define the role of a DevOps engineer?

A DevOps engineer is responsible for bridging the gap between the development and operations teams by facilitating the delivery of high-quality software products. They use automation tools and techniques to streamline the software development lifecycle, monitor and optimize system performance, and ensure continuous deployment and delivery.
Moreover, they ensure that everything in the development and operations process runs smoothly.

##### 3. How does DevOps differ from traditional software development methodologies?

DevOps differs from traditional software development methodologies in its collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery. Instead of having separate teams for development and operations, DevOps promotes cross-functional teams that work together to streamline the entire software development process.
DevOps also relies heavily on automation tools and techniques to accelerate development and ensure consistency, quality, and reliability in every lifecycle stage.

##### 4. How does HTTP work?

HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol works in a client–server model like most other protocols. HTTP provides a way to interact with web resources by transmitting hypertext messages between clients and servers.

##### 5. In terms of development and infrastructure, mention the core operations of DevOps.

The core operations of DevOps include:
* Development
* Version Control
* Testing
* Integration
* Deployment
* Delivery & Continuous Delivery
* Configuration
* Monitoring
* Feedback

##### 6. What are some technical and business benefits of DevOps?

###### Technical benefits:
* Continuous software delivery
* Less complex problems to fix
* Faster bug resolution

###### Business benefits:
* Faster delivery of features for customer satisfaction
* More stable operating environments
* More time available to add product value

##### 7. What is CI? What is its purpose?

CI stands for continuous integration. It is a software development process where developers frequently merge code changes into a central repository.
CI aims to detect issues early and ensure the codebase always works. By integrating code changes often, developers can identify and fix problems faster. This makes building, testing, and deploying the software easier.


##### 8. Name three important DevOps KPIs.

Three of the most common DevOps KPIs are:
* Meantime to failure recovery
* Deployment frequency
* Percentage of failed deployments

#### Intermediate DevOps Interview Questions

##### 9. Name some of the most important DevOps tools.

This is a list of the most important DevOps Tools being used:
* Git
* Maven
* Selenium
* Jenkins
* Docker
* Puppet
* Chef
* Ansible
* Nagios

##### 10. What are the core principles of DevOps?

The core principles of DevOps include continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation, collaboration, and monitoring. DevOps teams work together to automate as much of the software development process as possible, making it faster, more reliable, and more efficient.
They also collaborate closely to ensure everyone is on the same page and continuously working to improve the software through continuous monitoring and feedback loops.

##### 11. How do you measure the success of DevOps implementation?

To evaluate the success of a DevOps implementation, we can use key indicators such as the frequency of changes, the speed of implementation, error recovery time, and the incidents of issues arising from changes. These metrics enable us to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of our software development process. We can also ask for feedback from team members and clients to measure the satisfaction level with the software and its functionality.

##### 12. What is continuous delivery?

Continuous delivery is a software development practice that automates the release process. Its primary objective is to ensure that software is consistently prepared for deployment to production. This means that code changes are frequently integrated, built, tested, and deployed in a repeatable and automated manner. It helps the teams to reduce the time and effort required to release software while maintaining high quality and reliability. With continuous delivery, teams can release software more frequently and confidently.
